# VAE-FWI

------------------
VAE-FWI provides the uncertainty analysis of seismic full waveform inversion (FWI) using variational-autoencoder (VAE). The detailed theory can be found in the paper titled "Seismic full waveform inversion with uncertainty analysis using unsupervised variational deep learning", which is currently under reviewed (will be released soon).
